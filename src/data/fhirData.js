You are the best person to decide which method is right for you.","Content":"<p>Birth control (also called contraception) can help you prevent pregnancy when you don&rsquo;t want to have a baby. Male and female condoms can also help protect you and your sex partner from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).</p><h3>How do I choose the right birth control?</h3><p>There isn&rsquo;t one method of birth control that&rsquo;s right for everyone. Each type of birth control has pros and cons.</p><p>Here are some things to think about when choosing a birth control method:</p><ul><li>Do you want to have children some day? How soon?</li><li>Do you have any health conditions?</li><li>How often do you have sex?</li><li>How many sex partners do you have?</li><li>Do you also need protection against HIV and other STDs?</li><li>How well does the birth control method work?</li><li>Are there any side effects?</li><li>Will you be able to use it correctly every time?</li></ul><h3>How does birth control work?</h3><p>It depends on the type of birth control you use. Different methods of birth control work in different ways.&nbsp;</p><h4>IUDs (intrauterine devices)</h4><p>An IUD is a small, T-shaped piece of plastic with copper or hormones. It&rsquo;s put inside a woman&rsquo;s uterus by a doctor or nurse.</p><p>There are 2 kinds:</p><ul><li>Copper IUD &ndash; This releases a small amount of copper&nbsp;to prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg. It&nbsp;can last for up to 10&nbsp;years.</li><li>Hormonal IUD &ndash; Hormonal IUDs release a small amount of hormone&nbsp;to prevent pregnancy. There are 4 different types of hormonal IUDs. Two kinds can last for up to 5&nbsp;years and 2 can last for up to 3 years.</li></ul><p>An IUD is very effective at preventing pregnancy. You don&#39;t feel the IUD when it&rsquo;s in place &ndash; and there&#39;s nothing to do or remember.</p><p>If you have an IUD and you want to get pregnant, a doctor or nurse can easily remove it.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/http/www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/contraception/iud/?_label_=Read+more+about+IUDs\" >Read more about IUDs</a>.</p><h4>Hormonal methods</h4><p>These methods work by preventing a woman&rsquo;s ovaries from releasing an egg each month. They also cause other changes that make it more unlikely that a woman will get pregnant.</p><p>Some hormonal methods work better than others, and some require more effort to use. For example, birth control pills have to be taken every day, but an implant lasts for up to 3 years once it&#39;s in place.</p><p>Hormonal methods include:</p><ul><li>Hormonal IUD &ndash; can last for 3 to 5 years, depending on the type</li><li>Implant (a small rod put under the skin) &ndash; can last for 3 years</li><li>Shot &ndash; given by a doctor or nurse every 3 months</li><li>Patch &ndash; worn on the skin and replaced once a week, with one week off every month</li><li>Ring &ndash; put in the vagina and replaced once a month</li><li>Birth control pills &ndash; must be taken every day</li></ul><p>If you are interested in a hormonal method of birth control, talk with your doctor about which kind is best for you.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/http/www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/birth-control-methods.html?from=AtoZ&_hash_=%23hormet&_label_=Read+more+about+hormonal+birth+control+options.#hormet\" >Read more about hormonal birth control options.</a></p><h4>Barrier methods</h4><p>Barrier methods work by preventing the sperm and egg from touching each other. Common barrier methods include:</p><ul><li>Male condoms (worn on the penis)</li><li>Female condoms (placed on the outside and inside of the vagina)</li><li>Birth control diaphragm or cervical cap&nbsp;(placed inside the vagina)</li><li>Birth control sponge (placed inside the vagina)</li></ul><p>Male latex (rubber) condoms are also very effective at preventing HIV and reducing the risk of other STDs when used correctly every time you have sex. Female condoms may also help prevent HIV and other STDs. <a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/https/www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForWomen/FreePublications/ucm313215.htm?_hash_=%23BarrierMethods&_label_=Read+more+about+barrier+methods#BarrierMethods\">Read more about barrier methods</a>.</p><h4>Natural family planning (NFP)</h4><p>NFP works by learning which days a woman is more likely to get pregnant. People who want to prevent pregnancy don&rsquo;t have sex on these days or they use another method of birth control.</p><p>NFP is only an option for women who have regular periods. It&#39;s important to know that NFP is not typically as effective at preventing pregnancies as some other forms of birth control, like IUDs or hormonal methods.</p><p>Couples can also use NFP when they are trying&nbsp;to get pregnant.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/https/www.hhs.gov/opa/pregnancy-prevention/non-hormonal-methods/fertility-awareness-and-natural-family-planning/index.html?_label_=Read+more+about+natural+family+planning\">Read more about natural family planning</a>.</p><h4>Emergency contraception</h4><p>Sometimes people forget to use birth control (for example,&nbsp;they miss a pill or shot) or their birth control fails (like if the condom breaks).</p><p>There are 2 options for emergency contraception:</p><ul><li>Copper IUD &ndash;&nbsp;A doctor or nurse will need to place this inside the woman&rsquo;s uterus within 5 days of unprotected sex.</li><li>Emergency contraception pills (ECPs) &ndash;&nbsp;The woman will need to take ECPs as soon as possible within 5 days of unprotected sex. You can buy some ECPs at a drugstore without a prescription. To get other ECPs, you need a prescription from a doctor.</li></ul><p>Taking ECPs won&rsquo;t stop or harm a pregnancy if you are already pregnant.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/http/www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/emergency-contraception.html?_label_=Read+more+about+emergency+contraception+pills\" >Read more about emergency contraception pills</a>.</p><h4>Sterilization</h4><p>Sterilization is a permanent method of birth control. This is an option for people who are 100%&nbsp;sure they don&rsquo;t want any more children.</p><ul><li>In men, this means cutting or blocking the tubes that carry sperm to the outside of the penis. This is called a vasectomy. <a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/https/www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002995.htm?_label_=Read+more+about+sterilization+for+men\" >Read more about sterilization for men</a>.</li><li>In women, this means cutting or blocking the tubes that carry eggs into the uterus.

Female condoms may also lower the risk of some STDs.</p><p>Barrier methods used inside the vagina, like the female condom and diaphragm, can also lower the risk of some STDs.</p><p>Non-barrier methods (like birth control pills, IUDs, and other hormonal methods) don&rsquo;t prevent STDs. If you choose one of these types of birth control, keep in mind that it won&#39;t protect you from HIV and other STDs &ndash; so you may also&nbsp;want to use condoms for protection.</p><h3>Do I need to see a doctor to get birth control?</h3><p>It depends on which birth control method you choose. You can buy some birth control over&nbsp;the&nbsp;counter. Over&nbsp;the&nbsp;counter means you can buy it at a store without a prescription. For other methods, you will need to see a doctor or nurse.</p><h4>Birth control methods you can get without a prescription include:</h4><ul><li>Male condoms</li><li>Female condoms</li><li>Emergency contraception pills</li><li>Birth control sponge</li></ul><h4>Birth control methods you can get only from a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist include:</h4><ul><li>Birth control pills</li><li>Patch</li><li>Diaphragm and cervical cap</li><li>Shot</li><li>Ring&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>You need a medical procedure for:</h4><ul><li>Sterilization (for both women and men)</li><li>IUD&nbsp;(intrauterine device)</li><li>Implant&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Check out these resources to learn more about the different types of birth control:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/http/www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForWomen/FreePublications/ucm313215.htm?_label_=Birth+Control+Guide\" >Birth Control Guide</a></li><li><a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/http/www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/?_label_=Reproductive+Health+%26ndash%3b+Contraception+\" >Reproductive Health &ndash; Contraception </a></li></ul>"},{"Title":"Take Action!","Description":"Make an appointment to talk with a doctor or nurse about your birth control options.","Content":"<p>Follow these steps to choose the right birth control for you.</p><h3>Talk to a nurse, doctor, or family planning educator.</h3><p>Ask about the types of birth control that are available to you.

People who are overweight are more likely to get type&nbsp;2&nbsp;diabetes.</p><h4>What other types of diabetes are there?</h4><ul><li><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong> is caused by a problem with the immune system (the system that helps fight infection). Right now, there&rsquo;s no way to prevent type 1 diabetes.</li><li><strong>Gestational (&ldquo;jes-TAY-shon-al&rdquo;) diabetes </strong>is a type of diabetes that some women develop during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes increases the risk of health problems for you and your baby. For example, gestational diabetes can make it more likely that you&rsquo;ll develop type 2 diabetes after pregnancy.</li></ul><h3>Am I at risk for type 2 diabetes?</h3><p>You may be at risk for type 2 diabetes if you:</p><ul><li>Are over age 40</li><li>Are overweight or obese</li><li>Have a parent or sibling with diabetes</li><li>Are African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native American, Alaska Native, Asian American, or Pacific Islander</li><li>Have had gestational diabetes or given birth to a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds</li><li>Have polycystic ovary syndrome (when a woman&#39;s ovaries produce more male hormones than usual)</li><li>Have high blood pressure or cholesterol</li><li>Exercise less than 3 times a week</li><li>Have prediabetes</li></ul><h4>What is prediabetes?</h4><p>If you have prediabetes, the glucose levels in your blood are higher than usual &ndash; but not high enough to mean you have type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems, like heart disease and stroke.</p><p>The good news about prediabetes is that healthy changes, like losing weight and getting enough physical activity, can stop it from becoming type 2 diabetes. <a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/http/www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/index.html?_label_=Find+out+more+about+prediabetes\" >Find out more about prediabetes</a>.</p><h3>What are the symptoms of type 2 diabetes?</h3><p>Symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop over several years.

Arteries are the tubes that carry blood away from your heart. Every time your heart beats, it pumps blood through your arteries to the rest of your&nbsp;body.</p><p><strong>What is hypertension?</strong><br />Hypertension (&ldquo;hy-puhr-TEHN-shun&rdquo;) is the medical term for high blood pressure. High blood pressure has no signs or symptoms. The only way to know if you have high blood pressure is to get tested.</p><p>By taking steps to lower your blood pressure, you can reduce your risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Lowering your blood pressure can help you live a longer, healthier life.</p><p><strong>What do blood pressure numbers mean?</strong><br />A blood pressure test measures how hard your heart is working to pump blood through your body.</p><p>Blood pressure is measured with 2 numbers. The first number is the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. The second number is the pressure in your arteries between each beat, when your heart&nbsp;relaxes.</p><p>Compare your blood pressure to these numbers:</p><ul><li>Normal blood pressure is lower than 120/80 (said &ldquo;120 over 80&rdquo;).</li><li>High blood pressure is 140/90 or higher.</li><li>Blood pressure that&rsquo;s between normal and high (for example, 130/85) is called prehypertension (&ldquo;PREE-hy-puhr-tehn-shun&rdquo;), or high normal blood pressure.</li></ul><p><strong>How can I get my blood pressure checked?</strong><br />To test your blood pressure, a nurse or doctor will put a cuff around your upper arm. The cuff will be pumped with air until it feels tight, then the air will be slowly let out. This won&#39;t take more than a few minutes.</p><p>The nurse or doctor can tell you what your blood pressure numbers are right after the test is over. If the test shows that your blood pressure is high, ask the doctor what to do next.</p><p>Blood pressure can go up and down, so you may need to get it checked it more than once.</p><p><em><strong>Can I check my blood pressure by myself?</strong></em><br />Yes.&nbsp;Many shopping malls, pharmacies, and grocery stores have blood pressure machines you can use in the store. You can also buy a home blood pressure monitor at a drug store. If the test shows that your blood pressure is high, talk to a doctor.</p><p><strong>How can high blood pressure affect pregnancy?</strong><br />High blood pressure can be dangerous for a pregnant woman and her unborn baby. If you have high blood pressure and you want to get pregnant, it&rsquo;s important to take steps to lower your blood pressure first.</p><p>Sometimes, women get high blood pressure for the first time during pregnancy. This is called gestational (&ldquo;jes-TAY-shon-al&rdquo;) hypertension. Usually, this type of high blood pressure goes away after the baby is born.</p><p>If you have high blood pressure while you are pregnant, be sure to visit your doctor regularly.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/http/www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/resources/heart/hbp-pregnancy?_label_=Find+out+more+about+high+blood+pressure+during+pregnancy\" >Find out more about high blood pressure during pregnancy</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/https/healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/pregnancy/doctor-and-midwife-visits/have-a-healthy-pregnancy?_label_=Get+more+tips+on+how+to+have+a+healthy+pregnancy\">Get more tips on how to have a healthy pregnancy</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>What if I have high blood pressure?</strong><br />If you have high blood pressure, you may need medicine to control your blood&nbsp;pressure.</p><p>Print out this list of<a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/http/www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/HighBloodPressureToolsResources/Questions-to-Ask-Your-Doctor-About-Blood-Pressure_UCM_304907_Article.jsp?_label_=+questions+to+ask+your+doctor+about+blood+pressure\" > questions to ask your doctor about blood pressure</a>.</p><p>Take these steps to lower your blood pressure:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/https/healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/health-conditions-and-diseases/diabetes/eat-healthy?_label_=Eat+healthy+foods\">Eat healthy foods</a> that are low in saturated fat and sodium (salt).</li><li><a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/https/healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/health-conditions-and-diseases/diabetes/get-active?_label_=Get+active\">Get active</a>.

It&#39;s also possible to get the flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>Symptoms of the flu may include:</p><ul><li>Headache</li><li>Tiredness</li><li>Cough</li><li>Sore throat</li><li>Runny or stuffy nose</li><li>Muscle or body aches</li><li>Fever of 100 &deg;F or higher</li><li>Feeling feverish or having chills</li></ul><p>For some people, the flu may also cause vomiting (throwing up) and diarrhea (frequent, watery poop). This is more common in children than adults.</p><p>Remember, not everyone with the flu has a fever.</p><h3>How is the flu vaccine given?</h3><p>Most people get the flu vaccine as a shot. A nasal spray is available but it&#39;s not recommended because it may not provide the same protection as the shot.</p><p>The best way to protect yourself and others around you is to get a flu shot every year.&nbsp;</p><h3>Are there any side effects from the seasonal flu vaccine?</h3><p>For many people, getting a flu shot doesn&rsquo;t cause any side effects. If it does cause side effects, they are usually mild and begin soon after the vaccine is given. Side effects from the flu shot usually last 1 to 2 days.</p><p>Side effects may include:</p><ul><li>Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given</li><li>Low fever</li><li>Aches</li></ul><p>These side effects aren&rsquo;t the flu. You can&rsquo;t get the flu from the flu shot.</p><h3>Am I at high risk for serious complications from the flu?</h3><p>For some people, the flu is more likely to cause serious illness that can lead to hospitalization or even death.&nbsp;</p><p>People at high risk for getting complications from the flu include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/https/www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/children.htm?_label_=%3cstrong%3eChildren+under+age+5%3c%2fstrong%3e\"><strong>Children under age 5</strong></a> &ndash; especially children under age 2</li><li><a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/https/www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/pregnant.htm?_label_=%3cstrong%3ePregnant+women%3c%2fstrong%3e\"><strong>Pregnant women</strong></a> and women who&#39;ve had a baby in the last 2 weeks</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/https/www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/65over.htm?_label_=Adults+age+65+and+older\">Adults age 65 and older</a> </strong></li><li><a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/https/www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/high_risk.htm?_label_=%3cstrong%3ePeople+with+some+long-term+health+conditions%3c%2fstrong%3e\"><strong>People with some long-term health conditions</strong></a> (for example, asthma, diabetes, or heart disease)</li><li>People who live in long-term care facilities, like nursing homes</li><li><a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/api/Outlink/MyHFSearchV2/https/www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/freeresources/native/protect_circle_life_factsheet.pdf?_label_=%3cstrong%3eAmerican+Indians+and+Alaska+Natives%3c%2fstrong%3e+\"><strong>American Indians and Alaska Natives</strong> </a>[PDF - 1.1 MB]</li><li>People&nbsp;who are very obese</li></ul><p>If you are at high risk from the flu, it&rsquo;s especially important to get a vaccine before the flu starts to spread in your community.</p><p>If you care for or spend time with someone at high risk from the flu, you can protect both of you by getting a flu vaccine.</p><h3>Is there medicine that can treat the flu?</h3><p>Yes. If you get sick with the flu,&nbsp;your doctor may prescribe medicines called antiviral drugs. Antiviral drugs can help you feel less sick and&nbsp;shorten the time you are sick.</p><p>If you are at high risk for complications from the flu, it&rsquo;s important to ask your doctor about antiviral drugs right away.</p><p>Antiviral drugs work best if you start taking them in the first 2 days after you get sick.

Usually, adults with the flu can spread the virus starting the day before they first feel sick &ndash; and up to 5 to 7 days after they first felt sick. Children may be able to spread the virus for even longer than 7 days.</p><p></p>"}]},"MoreInfoItems":null,"HealthfinderLogo":"https://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/glmedia/bw_hf_logo.gif","HealthfinderUrl":"https://healthfinder.gov"},{"Type":"topic","Id":"16","Title":"Drink Alcohol Only in Moderation","TranslationId":"56","TranslationTitle":"Si tomas alcohol, hazlo con moderación","Categories":"Heart Health, Mental Health","Populations":"Mental Health and Relationships, Women","MyHFTitle":"Talk with a Doctor about Your Alcohol Use","MyHFDescription":"If you are concerned about your drinking, ask your doctor about screening and counseling.
